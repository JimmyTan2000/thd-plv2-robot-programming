# Conclusion and Takeaways
In this 8 days course in Robot Programming, I have really learned a lot. After getting some hands-on experience, I realised that programming a robot is not easy as I used to think. Working with physical robots are a very different experience than just dealing with software. As like anything in the reality, a lot of things are not ideal. For example, the LiDAR sensor of the physical robot may be broken, and there may be more sensor noise in a real, physical environment. Making softwares and hardwares to work together requires a lot of troubleshooting and sometimes fine tuning. 

In a nutshell, this course has taught me a lot of things and I am very satisfied with the outcome.
